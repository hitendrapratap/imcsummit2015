* Real Transactions <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* aggregation  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* write behind  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Didn't have it  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

note:
1. transactions and EP are super fast - Hiten will talk more about this
1. able to coalesce microservices
1. write behind made even better rate of transactions
1. paired with C* makes for very robust platform
